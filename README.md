<h2>Objective:</h2>
<p>Problem:
The objective is to analyze the safety offered by a CPU with software-based self-tests. “ The final goal is to understand and justify how to properly set such parameters for increasing the safety of the CPU”.</p>
<h2>Assumptions & Solutions:</h2>
<p>We did modeling and evaluation exercises for software-based self-tests for detecting Permanent faults in the CPU and move into safe mode, by using Mobius.</p>
<h2>What is Mobius?</h2>
<p>Mobius is a software tool for modeling the behavior of complex systems. Although it was originally developed for studying the reliability, availability, and performance of computer and network systems, its use has expanded rapidly. It is now used for a broad range of discrete-event systems, from biochemical reactions within genes to the effects of malicious attackers on secure computer systems.</p>
